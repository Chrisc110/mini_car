# Mini Car

This is a small project using a 3D printed chasis, ultrasonic sensors for object avidance, and stepper motors for control.

We are using an STM32F401RE Developement board.

The architecture is based on state machines and FreeRTOS. Although this architecture is likely not required for this project, it was used as a learning experience to
better understand the architecture.
